            <p><strong>july was actually insanely weird.</strong><br><br>
                mostly in that i vaguely recall still being in the first week of it BUT SOMEHOW WE'RE 
                IN AUGUST AND I'M FAILING TIME AGAIN. (#rude)<br><br>
                but also because i very uncharacteristically spent most of it doing other kinds of 
                ignoring-math-assignments shaped stuff that surprisingly DID NOT include reading and/or 
                writing, which is possibly even more shock-inducing than my unkempt foreignness with 
                time.<br><br>
                (AREN'T I FULL OF SURPRISES LIKE THAT)<br><br>
                i maybe one day successfully convinced myself that i'd grown bored of my smol blog looking 
                the same since an entire year and another half and therefore needed to have new and shiny 
                things thrown at it. so i did the throwing. which included creating the new featured image 
                graphics (BECAUSE I'M NOT WASTING CHOCOLATE BY THROWING IT INSTEAD, DARNIT) you probably
                saw on the rambles section of this otherworldly phenomenon (aka dipped in ink) if you're nice 
                like that, or didn't if you're not. and changing up themes and habitually freaking out over 
                the workings of the universe and such.<br><br>
                i'm currently on a misson to transfer the new graphics onto all the ancient ancient posts 
                and possibly edit everything while i'm at it because KILLING TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE SEE. 
                (shit that's such a terrible saying PEOPLE ARE DUMB)<br><br>
                although aforementioned editing may or may not have been on pause from the first of august 
                because like. i suck. (BUT SHHH YOU DIDN'T HEAR THAT FROM ME I'M FABULOUS QUEEN OF ALL AND OLIVE 
                EXTRAORDINAIRE. BOW TO ME, YOU WEAK LITTLE MORTALS YOU)<br><br>
                i maybe also spontaneously fell in love with coding (WHICH WAS AN ACCIDENT, CORNFLOUR. DON'T GLARE 
                LIKE THAT) after trying to learn html because i wanted to have entire control over this gremlin 
                blog (see i stay true to my bookish roots) and spent the rest of july working my way through 
                every single c++ tutorial i could find (because html was absurdly dull and i therefore abandoned 
                that mission to learn The Hardest Programming Language On The Net™)<br><br>
                (nice times, i think)<br><br></p>
                <h2 class = "subsection one">on books and what the olive read</h2><br>
                it's humiliating writing wrap-ups where i've read less than eight books (especially after proclaiming
                how i could easily read over 200) because i'm afraid that might take away from my (albeit 
                self-appointed) position as queen of the universe.<br><br>
                but in july i was a failure and read five books (all of them digital BECAUSE HELLO HAVE YOU MET ME 
                I'M INCAPABLE OF ANYTHING ELSE). three o' the five were full-length novels, the fourth one a comic and 
                a king lear reading-guide-cum-reference-book (after a failed attempt at comprehending the events of 
                the 2017 adaptation WHY DO THEY TALK LIKE SHAKESPEARE DID BUT STILL DRIVE AROUND IN CARS??) 
                (#theOliveIsConfused) coming in fifth. but we won't talk about that here. mostly because 1) the cover's 
                an ugly ugly mix of neon yellow and black stripes and i refuse to have it littering everything THOSE 
                IDIOTIC BEASTS. and 2) it was terrible and i hated it and deemed it trashy so maybe just read another 
                one of my reviews for the books-i-hate and you'll get the basics.<br><br>
                (smol sidenote BUT CLICK ON THE LINKS IN THE BULLET POINTS UNDERNEATH THE BOOK HEADINGS. to read larger 
                reviews and more screams) (I'M NOT GOING TO HACK YOUR LAPTOP, BOB) (and click on the book covers if you 
                want to jump to goodreads. although i'd like it better if you stayed, BUT HEY. YOUR WISH)<br><br>
                
                <h3 class = "book one">something more by jackie khalilieh</h3>
                <p>this was a disaster made of words and i'm mad.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the plot basically revolves around a 15-year-old girl who gets diagnosed with autism right before 
                        her freshman year of high school and swears to keep it a secret from everyone at school 
                        (#ItDoesn'tWork)</li>
                    <li>she also falls in love with a boy and makes some really shitty friends who are basically just 
                        Jerks™ and also befriends a kid in her art class and dumps all her problems on him (their friendship 
                        is so one-sided and artificial?? i don't get it??).</li>
                    <li>but then the boy she befriended falls in love with her too and throws a fit when she doesn't realize 
                        it because OH HE WAS SO OBVIOUS HOW COULD SHE NOT LOVE HIM (#JERK. like, grow the frick UP dude)</li>
                    <li>most of this book is actually populated by Dumb People doing Dumb Things so i'm not sure how useful 
                        it really is.</li>
                    <li>(maybe keep a 2 mile distance at all times AND NEVER READ IT BECAUSE I WARNED YOU) (you're welcome)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class = "book two">everyday use by alice walker</h3>
                <p>i read this for school and i always have very Complicated thoughts on stuff i read for school 
                    (because i hate school SO AM I ALSO SUPPOSED TO HATE EVERYTHING IT TELLS ME TO DO IN AN ATTEMPT AT 
                    SOLIDARITY??) (i'm confused and need someone to tell me what the heck to do with my life)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>this was kind of nice and kind of not but mostly i haven't thought about it very much, so 
                        like,,, idk dude. i feel like i'm supposed to have “read between the lines”, but there's only 
                        blank spaces between them SO?? HOW DO I READ THAT??</li>
                    <li>it's about two daughters, one of whom burned their childhood home (or that is what i got 
                        anyway?? maybe i should reread) and it's about their mother and about how much all of their views 
                        on the world they live in and the way they're treated in it differ.</li>
                    <li>(it's kind of nice like that)</li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class = "book three">this savage song by v. e. schwab</h3>
                <p>welcome to my most favorite book in what's probably half a year.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>this was a wild ride and i?? loved it so much ok.</li>
                    <li>it's populated by all sorts of monsters and it's kind of gory and a little bit dark and it's about 
                        a girl and a boy who are attacked and run away and get betrayed.</li>
                    <li>there's also a cat and they talk about how cats make better pets than monsters who dream of killing 
                        you and maybe i have an unhealthy obsession with cats BUT WE DON'T TALK ABOUT THAT SO SHUT UP.</li>
                    <li>i'm so darn glad this book exists</li>
                    <li>also i haven't lovedlovedloved a book in such a LONG TIME (if you can't tell) so i love you about 
                        37363x more for writing this, schwab, YOU FABULOUS MONSTER.</li>
                    <li>(OH AND click <a href = "post3.html">here</a> to access live word footage of me screaming about

                <h3 class = "book four">heartstopper volume 1 by alice oseman</h3>
                <p>so the plan was to be characteristically phenomenal and binge the entire graphic novel series before season 
                    2 came out. which was obviously an epic failure since we're way past the 3rd august deadline of fabulous 
                    completion. so here's the lone book, you.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>am pretty sure that if there's one book in the world i could read for the rest of time and not get bored 
                        of to the point where i scream and chuck it at the wall, it'd be this one.</li>
                    <li>my thoughts are pretty much the same as the first time i read it, but i have a smol growing suspicion that 
                        i maybe keep liking it a little bit more every time i read it.</li>
                    <li>WHICH WOULD BE A PROBLEM BUT LIKE. nick and charlie are my kids AND I LOVE THEM.</li>
                    <li>also tara and darcy but especially darcy. SHE HAS LIKE ONE LINE IN THIS BOOK BUT SHE STILL STEALS MY SOUL 
                        AND I'M CONFUSED ABOUT IT.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>(so that was nice)</p>
                <h2 class = "subsection two">on all the television consumed</h2>
                <p>i was a potato this month and most of my story consumption came in the form of learning how a microwave 
                    worked and listening to taylor swift songs while doing useless things every day. and like,,, it SHOWS (ha ha, 
                    pun intended. ha) (ok i'll stop now)</p>

                    it was released AND AM VERY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR BREAKING ALL MY RULES. (#rebel)</p>

                <h3 class = "tv two">oppenheimer</h3>
                <p>i've spent all my life since fifth grade (fifth grade was actually very cool. we had this entire portion of 
                    the textbook that talked about nothing except the wars and everyone in our class had an obsession with 
                    hitler wherein we spent all our free periods copying his mustaches on paper and sticking them onto our faces 
                    to see who got it most accurate) obsessing over the second world war and greadily eating up every single 
                    piece of media and internet article and fiction book i manage to find about it, and i can still effortlessly 
                    confirm that this is officially the best thing anyone's ever created.</p>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>HELLO, my new favorite movie of all time (which is actually a much rarer title than it sounds because 
                        i'm firmly convinced that tv shows far succeed movies in being generally phenomenal, and i only have like,,, 
                        three others that i can thoughtlessly declare favorites) (and i've watched a LOT of movies)</li>
                    <li>oppenheimer's character is so COOL and the most realistic television portrayal of what humans are actually 
                        like to ever exist BUT ALSO SO COOL OH MY GOSH. i love science-y movies that are technical and ridiculous 
                        and exciting and talk about humanity and revolve around ambition and obsession and disasters. and then this 
                        kind of blew the world and my expectations by also adding the second world war into it all SO LIKE YAY.</li>
                    <li>I LITERALLY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO SAY ABOUT THIS LIKE DUDE IT WAS OTHERWORLDLY GENIUS AND I'M A WEIRD STUTTERING
