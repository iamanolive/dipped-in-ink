            <p class = "excerpt1"><strong>i like to think that i've read a considerable amount of science fiction in my life.</strong>
                <br><br>two years ago, i spent an entire week of school evenings devouring the lunar chronicles and coming out the other end 
                slightly angry because the hype lied and i could think up about 38163 better uses of my time. i've read three of the five books 
                since and i'm wholly convinced it's actually very lame (OK except maybe fairest. villain backstories are tragically irresistible 
                even to fabulous beings (me) and i'm weak like that) (BUT SECRETS)
                <br><br>earlier this year, i borrowed the entirety of the starbound trilogy from the library and spent weeks very patiently
                dragging myself and my lone existing brain cell through the mess. i succeeded in completing (as a tribute to my ever-expanding 
                tolerance) two of the three books and spent about 288% of my time screeching at the characters (in my defence, they were dumb 
                people and seemed to have nothing better to do in life than fall in love with the first person who looked their way while there 
                were entire species at risk right next door because WHAT THE HELL) (ok so look,,, i kind of always assumed that people 
                wouldn't spend all their time deciding between playing the romeo-and-juliets of the modern world who kiss the enemy instead of 
                being the mad scientists who are utterly obsessed with interplanetary travel. because DUDE you have magic JUST LYING AROUND 
                EVERYWHERE) (people are so dumb)

                mostly in that i vaguely recall still being in the first week of it BUT SOMEHOW WE'RE IN AUGUST AND I'M FAILING 
                TIME AGAIN. (#rude)<br><br>
                but also because i very uncharacteristically spent most of it doing other kinds of ignoring-math-assignments shaped stuff 
                that surprisingly DID NOT include reading and/or writing, which is possibly even more shock-inducing than my unkempt 
                foreignness with time.<br><br>
                (AREN'T I FULL OF SURPRISES LIKE THAT)<br><br>
                i maybe one day successfully convinced myself that i'd grown bored of my smol blog looking the same since an entire year and 
                another half and therefore needed to have new and shiny things thrown at it. so i did the throwing. which included creating 
                the new featured image graphics (BECAUSE I'M NOT WASTING CHOCOLATE BY THROWING IT INSTEAD, DARNIT) you probably saw on the 
                rambles section of this otherworldly phenomenon (aka dipped in ink) if you're nice like that, or didn't if you're not. and 
                changing up themes and habitually freaking out over the workings of the universe and such.<br><br>

            <p class = "excerpt3"><strong>i have this bad habit where i read the first chapters of books about 47645 times before moving on
                to read the rest of it's entirety.</strong><br><br>
                and it's bad because i happen to be an interminable idiot who only does this to the books she likes and makes it her life 
                mission to read every single book whose first-chapter she's ever hated and see it until the end.<br><br>
                i don't know, man. falling in love with books is scary because they take over my life and make me want to read them about a 
                thousand times over and every other book i've ever read seems so dull and worthless in comparison. they make suing the world 
                seem like such a fun prospect BECAUSE THE WORLD IS SO PLAIN AND BORING.<br><br>
                (why can't we have monsters and star-covered girls named ilsa who fall in love with cats)<br><br>
                which is maybe why i run away from stories that promise greatness.<br><br>
