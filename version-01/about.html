                ENEMY. OR OVE. I LOVE THE NET AND IT'S BASICALLY KIND OF MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE, 
                EXCUSE YOU) is that time when you're asked to put in an entire frickin paragraph

                because, like, what if this happens: “WOW I KNOW SO MUCH ABOUT ME WHERE DO I EVEN START”. 
                (and then you never do) or maybe: “OK OK SO THIS IS AWKWARD CAN SOMEONE KINDLY TAKE OVER 
                THE WORLD FROM ME PLEASE” (which CANNOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THE WORLD IS MINE AND I WANT IT) 
                or maybe: “HA. YOU KNOW WHAT? I ACTUALLY HAVE SO MANY WORDS RIGHT NOW I COULD WRITE NOVELS 
                AND FILL ALL OF THE ENTIRE WORLD WITH THEM”. and then a nosy child acidentally discovers 
                you five centuries later, buried under papers and pens and brokenly outdated laptops, all 
                your life-written books creating your home. AFTER WHICH YOU BECOME AN UNEARTHLY MIRACLE 
                BECAUSE WOW YOU'VE LIVED FIVE CENTURIES. and somehow never seen most of the world. WOW YOU.

                hence the reason we find ourselves over here again, in this unnervingly feared page on the one

                since you willingly clicked further than the homepage i assume you were initially directed to, we

                apart from that though (DON'T GET TOO USED TO THE PRAISE, OLIVE. I;M GENERALLY MUCH MORE

                BUT. if you still find yourself here after the numerous warnings (thus furthering the nature of 
                my feared self-obsession), let's talk.
            </p>

            <p class = "margin10">
                my name is anoushka and i am in love with words. i live off of chaos and pain and my heart is a 
                dark black hollow that has never seen then light of day.
            </p>

            <p class = "margin11">
                just kidding.

            <p class = "margin12">
                my name is anoushka, but they call me the olive queen because i prefer it that way. my greatest-ever 
                ambition is to take over the world and read every single book in it. i love leigh bardugo and shall 
                squeak pretty endlessly if you ask about her. (i have a smol little obsession like that) i am kaz 
                brekker stan before human AND BASICALLY LOVE HIM AND SHALL HAND OVER THE WORLD if that's what 
                he wants.
            </p>

            <p class = "margin13">
                i also one day want to write a book and perhaps read every single one ever written but we're keeping 
                the ambitions smol. BUT ONE DAY WHEN I CONQUER ALL, MY LIST WILL REACH THE MOON AND BACK.

            </p>

            <h3>a smol introduction of olively sorts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>name: the world-feared olive queen</li>
                <li>age: immortality is a secret i've long since discovered. AND I WON'T SHARE.</li>
                <li>current obsessions: the fact that cait's new book comes out 2024 and i've been researching time 
                    machines and also human hibernation ever since. AND THAT I SCREAM ABOUT IT EVERY SINGLE DAY. I NEED 2024 
                    SO BAD OK. but also kaz brekker because brekker rules.</li>
                <li>favorite book types: all things humor and heartbreak. although I shall be on-the-spot obsessed if the 
                    book in question has them both. IT'S SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN PERFECTION (self-proven would probably be 
                    more accurate actually, but it's ok. i make the rules here)</li>
                <li>all that you've just entered: a world where olives rule the universe. and dragons help in conquering 
                    it. ALSO BOOKS ARE OXYGEN AROUND HERE, and highly necessary like that. so welcome to words and 
                    stories and magic. AND THE SMOLLEST EVER BITS OF OCCASIONAL WHIMSY. i'm bad.</li>
                <li>what you shall find here: olivish overloads, tips to conquering the worlds and raiding chocolate stores 
                    and HEISTING LIBRARIES. also occasional talk of books and THE AMAZINGNESS OF WORDS and living in 
                    libraries forever. OH AND DOGS BECAUSE I'M OBSESSED.</li>

            <h3>books i call my favorite obsessions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    six of crows and all things leigh bardugo: BECAUSE HELLO BARDUGO RULES. and i shall gladly bequeath 
                    the universe to her and all my dragons and serve as her charioteer for the rest of ever. also six of 
                    crows is perfect and i suggest you never ever ever read it because it makes all the other books seem 
                    like trash in comparison. AND I'M GUESSING YOU DO NOT WANT THAT.
                </li>
                <li>
                    a series of unfortunate events: sunny's the cutest. AND I LOVE COUNT OLAF.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the seven husbands of evelyn hugo and everything of ever that bears the name of taylor jenkins reid
                </li>
                <li>
                    percy jackson and the olympians who saved my life: one day i shall learn archery and fight demons with 
                    a sword (OR A MINOTAUR HORN. we aren't very fussy) (AS LONG AS IT'S A MINOTAUR HORN)
                </li>
                <li>little women</li>
                <li>the raven boys</li>
                <li>
                    the boy who steals houses and the book that stole my heart
                </li>
                <li>
                    anne of green gables. and my smol dragons: see anne basically saved my life in middle school SO I OWE 
                    HER THIS. montgomery kind of also tops the list in “books anoushka has read over a dozen times” and 
                    “obsessively thinks about in the shower and everytime she has a conversation” SO.
                </li>
                <li>
                    only mostly devastated: i have the smollest ever obsession with books that once upon a time made 
                    me laugh into the dead of nightfall and led to waking up of the entire household with my mindless 
                    rule-breaking. i also have a soft spot for books that talk about ants and whether or not they 
                    possess red blood. because it's such a criminally undiscussed topic okay. but then this book 
                    happened. AND IT MADE THE WORLD WHOLE AGAIN. i like that.
                </li>
                <li>
                    the lesbiana's guide to catholic school: I JUST LIKE HILARIOUS BOOKS WITH SAD LITTLE CHARACTERS 
                    WHO LOVE THE WORLD DESPITE EVERY REASON POINTING AGAINST IT OKAY. the lesbiana's guide RULES.
                </li>
                <li>not my problem</li>
                <li>
                    this is going to hurt: EVERYONE, QUICK. ACT SHOCKED. mostly because anoushka never reads non-fiction so i'’s 
                    slightly AGAINST THE RULES how one ended up on this list. THE ONE THAT SCREAMS FAVORITES. but look adam kay 
                    is magic and this was fun and hilarious and filled with so much sarcasm but also just a little bit painful. 
                    AND PERFECT. (go away)
                </li>
